## Logger app for golf shots

The name of the app is "Drange Logs". It is made to help with logging shots while practising in a driving range facility. Typical use cases are:
- in lieu of pen and paper, record the shots in one of the two user interfaces suiting different preferences;
- export (share) the current entries using _logs_ to Google Keep or Gmail, for example;
- under options menu, export (backup) the app database (with all entries) to a shared local SD card. Use an external sqlite tool to edit the entries.
